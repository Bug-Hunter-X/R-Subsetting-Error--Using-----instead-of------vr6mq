# R Subsetting Error: Using `=` instead of `==`

This repository demonstrates a common error in R programming related to subsetting data frames.  The error arises from the incorrect use of the assignment operator (`=`) in place of the equality operator (`==`) when specifying subsetting conditions.

The `bug.R` file contains code illustrating the error, while `bugSolution.R` shows the corrected version.

This is a subtle but frequently encountered error that can lead to unexpected results and difficult-to-debug problems.  The example highlights the importance of paying close attention to operator usage in R.
